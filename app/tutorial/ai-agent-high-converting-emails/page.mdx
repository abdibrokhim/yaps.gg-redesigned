```

### Step 2: Create python vertual environment and activate it.
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
> on MacOS.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal. Run:
```bash
pip install gradio openai python-dotenv
```

### Step 4: Import Libraries and Load Environment Variables

Import `gradio`, `openai`, and `dotenv`. 

Use `dotenv` to load the `.env` file with your API key.

```py
import os
import gradio as gr
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# -----------------------------
# Load environment variables and initialize OpenAI client
# -----------------------------
load_dotenv()
```

Initialize the OpenAI client with your AI/ML API key.

```py
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.aimlapi.com/v1",
    api_key=os.getenv("AIML_API_KEY"),
)
```

Here's a brief tutorial: [How to get API Key from AI/ML API. Quick step-by-step tutorial with screenshots for better understanding.](https://medium.com/@abdibrokhim/how-to-get-api-key-from-ai-ml-api-225a69d0bb25)

### Step 5: Map Outreach Types to Instruction Files

Create a mapping (dictionary) that links each outreach type to its corresponding `.txt` file.

This will help the app load the correct system instructions.

```py
# -----------------------------
# Mapping of Outreach Type to System Instruction File
# -----------------------------
FILE_MAPPING = {
    "Cold Email Outreach": "cold_email_outreach.txt",
    "Warm Email Outreach": "warm_email_outreach.txt",
    "Customer Development Outreach": "customer_development_outreach.txt",
    "Link-Building Outreach": "link_building_outreach.txt",
    "Influencer Outreach": "influencer_outreach.txt",
    "Guest Blogging Outreach": "guest_blogging_outreach.txt",
    "Review and Rating Outreach": "review_and_rating_outreach.txt",
}

# -----------------------------
# Directory where the system instruction files are stored
# -----------------------------
FILE_DIR = "prompts"
```

### Step 6: Define Additional Fields Configuration

List all extra fields required for each email outreach type.

This allows dynamic display of input fields based on user selection.

```py
# -----------------------------
# Configuration for Additional Fields per Outreach Type
# Each key is the outreach type and its value is a list of field keys.
# (Field keys below match the keys used for our additional input components.)
# -----------------------------
FIELDS_CONFIG = {
    "Cold Email Outreach": ["recipient_name", "recipient_company", "industry", "pain_points"],
    "Warm Email Outreach": ["reference_details"],
    "Customer Development Outreach": ["customer_insights"],
    "Link-Building Outreach": ["target_website_url", "content_reference"],
    "Influencer Outreach": ["influencer_platform", "collaboration_idea"],
    "Guest Blogging Outreach": ["proposed_topics", "your_experience"],
    "Review and Rating Outreach": ["experience_details"]
}

# -----------------------------
# The order of all possible additional field keys (to ensure consistent update order)
# -----------------------------
ALL_FIELD_KEYS = [
    "recipient_name",
    "recipient_company",
    "industry",
    "pain_points",
    "reference_details",
    "customer_insights",
    "target_website_url",
    "content_reference",
    "influencer_platform",
    "collaboration_idea",
    "proposed_topics",
    "your_experience",
    "experience_details",
]
```

### Step 7: Create Functions for Dynamic Behavior

Write a function to show/hide additional fields based on the selected outreach type.

```py
# -----------------------------
# Define the function that updates the visibility of additional fields 
# based on the selected Email Outreach type.
# -----------------------------
def update_additional_fields(selected_type):
    # For each possible field key, set visible True if it is required for this outreach type.
    updates = []
    visible_keys = FIELDS_CONFIG.get(selected_type, [])
    for key in ALL_FIELD_KEYS:
        if key in visible_keys:
            updates.append(gr.update(visible=True))
        else:
            updates.append(gr.update(visible=False, value=""))
    return tuple(updates)
```

Email Generation Function:

Write a function to load the system instruction from the selected file.

```py
# -----------------------------
# Define the function to generate the email using AI/ML API.
#
# This function will:
#  1. Load the system instruction (prompt) from the corresponding .txt file.
#  2. Combine the additional fields into a user prompt.
#  3. Send both messages to the API.
#  4. Return the generated email text (in Markdown format).
# -----------------------------
def generate_email(email_type, 
                   recipient_name, recipient_company, industry, pain_points,
                   reference_details, customer_insights,
                   target_website_url, content_reference,
                   influencer_platform, collaboration_idea,
                   proposed_topics, your_experience,
                   experience_details):
    # Load the system instruction from file
    filename = FILE_MAPPING.get(email_type)
    try:
        with open(FILE_DIR+"/"+filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            system_instruction = f.read()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error reading system file '{filename}': {e}"
```

Combine user inputs into a single string.

```py
    # Combine additional field values into one additional-information string.
    # Only include fields that have non-empty values.
    additional_fields = {
        "Recipient Name": recipient_name,
        "Recipient Company": recipient_company,
        "Industry": industry,
        "Pain Points": pain_points,
        "Reference Details": reference_details,
        "Customer Insights": customer_insights,
        "Target Website URL": target_website_url,
        "Content Reference": content_reference,
        "Influencer Platform": influencer_platform,
        "Collaboration Idea": collaboration_idea,
        "Proposed Topics": proposed_topics,
        "Your Experience": your_experience,
        "Experience Details": experience_details,
    }
    additional_info = ""
    for label, value in additional_fields.items():
        if value.strip():
            additional_info += f"**{label}:** {value.strip()}\n\n"
    
    if not additional_info:
        additional_info = "No additional details provided."

    # Build the messages list.
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_instruction},
        {"role": "user", "content": additional_info}
    ]
```

Call the AI/ML API with a system message and user message. Return the generated email in Markdown format.

```py
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=messages,
        )
        email_text = response.choices[0].message.content
    except Exception as e:
        email_text = f"Error generating email: {e}"
    
    return email_text
```

### Step 8: Build the Gradio Interface

Use `gr.Blocks` to create the app layout.

```py
with gr.Blocks(title="Email Crafting Tool") as demo:
    
    gr.Markdown("# ‚úâÔ∏è AI Email Crafting Tool")
    gr.Markdown("Craft hyper-personalized outreach emails with ease. Select an outreach type, fill in the additional details, and let the AI generate a tailored email for you.")
```

Add a dropdown for selecting the Email Outreach type.

```py
with gr.Row():
        email_type = gr.Dropdown(
            label="Select Email Outreach Type",
            choices=list(FILE_MAPPING.keys()),
            value="Cold Email Outreach",
            interactive=True
        )
```

Add input fields for additional details.

```py
    with gr.Column(variant="panel"):
        gr.Markdown("### Additional Details")
        # Create additional fields ‚Äì all initially hidden. They will be shown conditionally.
        recipient_name = gr.Textbox(label="Recipient Name", placeholder="Enter recipient's name", visible=False)
        recipient_company = gr.Textbox(label="Recipient Company", placeholder="Enter recipient's company", visible=False)
        industry = gr.Textbox(label="Industry", placeholder="Enter industry", visible=False)
        pain_points = gr.Textbox(label="Pain Points", placeholder="Enter known challenges or pain points", lines=2, visible=False)
        reference_details = gr.Textbox(label="Reference Details", placeholder="Mention any previous interactions", visible=False)
        customer_insights = gr.Textbox(label="Customer Insights / Questions", placeholder="What insights or questions do you have?", lines=2, visible=False)
        target_website_url = gr.Textbox(label="Target Website URL", placeholder="Enter the target website URL", visible=False)
        content_reference = gr.Textbox(label="Content Reference", placeholder="Mention relevant content or article details", lines=2, visible=False)
        influencer_platform = gr.Textbox(label="Influencer Platform", placeholder="Enter the influencer's platform (e.g., Instagram, YouTube)", visible=False)
        collaboration_idea = gr.Textbox(label="Collaboration Idea", placeholder="Briefly describe the collaboration idea", lines=2, visible=False)
        proposed_topics = gr.Textbox(label="Proposed Topics", placeholder="List one or more guest post topics", lines=2, visible=False)
        your_experience = gr.Textbox(label="Your Experience", placeholder="Share your expertise or experience", lines=2, visible=False)
        experience_details = gr.Textbox(label="Experience Details", placeholder="Describe your experience with the product/service", lines=2, visible=False)
    
    # When the outreach type changes, update the visibility of the additional fields.
    email_type.change(
        fn=update_additional_fields, 
        inputs=email_type, 
        outputs=[
            recipient_name, recipient_company, industry, pain_points,
            reference_details, customer_insights,
            target_website_url, content_reference,
            influencer_platform, collaboration_idea,
            proposed_topics, your_experience,
            experience_details
        ]
    )
```

Add a button to generate the email.

```py
    with gr.Row():
        generate_btn = gr.Button("Generate Email", variant="primary")
```

Add an output component (like `gr.Code`) to display the generated email in Markdown with a copy button (by default there is copy and downlaod functions).

```py
    # Use a gr.Code component to render Markdown and include a built-in copy-to-clipboard button.
    output_email = gr.Code(label="Generated Email (Markdown)", language="markdown")
```

Link the input changes and button clicks to their corresponding functions.

```py
    generate_btn.click(
        fn=generate_email,
        inputs=[
            email_type,
            recipient_name, recipient_company, industry, pain_points,
            reference_details, customer_insights,
            target_website_url, content_reference,
            influencer_platform, collaboration_idea,
            proposed_topics, your_experience,
            experience_details
        ],
        outputs=output_email,
    )
```

Optional: Add a separator line for visual clarity.

```py
    gr.Markdown("___")
    gr.Markdown("¬© 2025 AI Email Crafting Tool")
```
